## SoC Design and OpenLANE

**What is a PDK?**
- PDK stands for Process Design Kit.
- It is a collection of files used to model a fabrication process for the EDA tools used to design an IC
  - Process Design Rules.
  - Device Models
  - Digital Standard Cell Libraries
  - I/O Libraries
 
A simplified RTL to GDSII Flow is :
- Synthesis -> Floor/Power Planning -> Placement -> Clock Tree Synthesis -> Routing -> Signoff

- Synthesis - Converts RTL to a ciruit, out of compomments from the standard cell library.
- Floor and Power Planning - Obejctive here is to plan the silicon area and create robust power distribution network to power the chip.
  - Chip Floor Planning - Partition the chip die between different system building blocks and place the I/O pads.
  - Macro Floor Planning - We define the macro dimensions, pin locations and rows are defined.
  - Power Planning - The power distribution network is contructed.
- Placement - Placing the cells on the floorplan rows, aligned with the sites. There are 2 steps: Global and Detailed.
- Clock Tree Synthesis - To deliver the clock to all sequential elements.
- Routing - Implement the interconnect using the available metal layers.
- Sign Off - Perform physical verification such as DRC(Design Rule Check) and LVS(Layout vs Synthesis). Also perform STA(Static Timiing Analysis).
