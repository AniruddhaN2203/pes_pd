# Day 1
## SoC Design and OpenLANE

**What is a PDK?**
- PDK stands for Process Design Kit.
- It is a collection of files used to model a fabrication process for the EDA tools used to design an IC
  - Process Design Rules.
  - Device Models
  - Digital Standard Cell Libraries
  - I/O Libraries
 
A simplified RTL to GDSII Flow is :
- Synthesis -> Floor/Power Planning -> Placement -> Clock Tree Synthesis -> Routing -> Signoff

- Synthesis - Converts RTL to a ciruit, out of compomments from the standard cell library.
- Floor and Power Planning - Obejctive here is to plan the silicon area and create robust power distribution network to power the chip.
  - Chip Floor Planning - Partition the chip die between different system building blocks and place the I/O pads.
  - Macro Floor Planning - We define the macro dimensions, pin locations and rows are defined.
  - Power Planning - The power distribution network is contructed.
- Placement - Placing the cells on the floorplan rows, aligned with the sites. There are 2 steps: Global and Detailed.
- Clock Tree Synthesis - To deliver the clock to all sequential elements.
- Routing - Implement the interconnect using the available metal layers.
- Sign Off - Perform physical verification such as DRC(Design Rule Check) and LVS(Layout vs Synthesis). Also perform STA(Static Timiing Analysis).

## Getting Familiar with the Open Source EDA Tools

### Design Preparation Step

- Let us first go the the working directory using the following commands
```
cd Desktop/work/tools/
```

```
cd openlane_working_dir/openlane/
```
- We now type the command ```docker```.
- This will open the shell as shown in the figure above
- Now we type
```
./flow.tcl -interactive
```
- If the 'interactive' keyword is not present, then the entire flow of the tool is run.

- Now we must import all the packages required to run the flow, we use the command:
```
package require openlane 0.9
```

- We will be working with the 'picorv32a' design.
- The src folder has the verilog file and the sdc file of the design
- Now we do the design setup stage using the command:
```
prep -design picorv32a
```

- After preparing the design, we can see that a new 'runs' folder is created.

- To synthesize the design we type
```
run_synthesis
```
- This command invokes yosys, runs the synthesis and the abc commands.
- A long process is observed after typing this command, which for a little over two mintues.

- A synthesis successful message must be displayed.

- The flop ratio can be calculated by using:
```
No. of flops/No. of cells = 1613/14876 = 0.108
```
- In percentage there is 10.8% of the total number of cells are Flops

- Under the runs folder we can check out the netlist file generated after synthesis

# Day 2
## Chip Floor Planning Considerations

**Utilization Factor and Aspect Ratio**

![image](https://github.com/AniruddhaN2203/pes_pd/assets/142299140/a1812369-af71-48c4-860c-f76af506400e)
- We consider a simple netlist with a Launch and Capture Flop. It also has an AND and OR gate.
- We then convert it into squares since we need appropriate dimensions

![image](https://github.com/AniruddhaN2203/pes_pd/assets/142299140/f7148664-ea48-420e-92a6-b5ef5ebc30fd)
- Let us consider the areas of the gates and Flops as 1 sq unit

![image](https://github.com/AniruddhaN2203/pes_pd/assets/142299140/6b3f5692-c22e-4c21-857d-d689adf834f0)
- Clubbing them together we get an area of 4 sq units

- The 'core' section of a chip is where the fundamental logic design is placed.
- The 'die' area contains the core and is a small semiconductor are on which the fundamental circuit is fabricated.

- Now we put the netlist in the 'core' area and check the utilization.
- Here
```
Utilization Factor = Area Occupied by the Netlist/Total Area of the Core
```
- As we can see here, there is 100% utilization and ```Utilization Factor = 1```.
- In practical scenarios we don't go for such a high utilization factor.
- The 'Aspect Ratio = Height/Width = 1'.

**Concept of Pre Placed Cells**
